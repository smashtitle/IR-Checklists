## Authentication
- [ ] 4624: Successful logon. Security [MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624)
	- LogonType 3 and 10 are indicators of remote access
	- LogonType 3 and LogonProcess "NtLmSsp" may indicate an NTLM relay attack (correlate source IP with Event ID 8004 to find mismatches, check for Anonymous Logon user)
    - LogonType 9 and Logon Process "seclogo" are common indicators of Pass-the-Hash
